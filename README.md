Features Include: 
1. Audio-to-Braille Conversion
•	Users can upload or record audio files directly within the GUI. The software utilizes advanced speech-to-text technology to transcribe spoken content into a textual format. The text is then converted into Braille, allowing users to read the content using Braille displays or embossers. 

2. Braille-to-Audio Conversion
•	For users who prefer auditory feedback from Braille materials, Tactidio provides an intuitive way to convert Braille text back into spoken words. Users can input Braille files or use Braille input devices to enter text. The software then translates the Braille into readable text and utilizes text-to-speech (TTS) technology to generate high-quality audio. 

3. Image-to-Braille Conversion
